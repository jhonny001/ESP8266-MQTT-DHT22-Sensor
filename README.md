# MQTT-DHT22-Sensor
ESP8266 DHT22 MQTT Low Energy sensor powered by battery

# Components
For this project you will need:
- ESP8266 (I used a bare ESP12-F as I needed the quiescent current to be as low as possible)
- DHT22 sensor
- 18650 Battery and holder
- Voltage Regulator HT7333
- Tantalum Capacitor 1000uF to reduce current spikes that can cause the ESP8266 to fail.

# Instructions
- bla bla bla
